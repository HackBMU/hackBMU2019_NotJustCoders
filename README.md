# Clorify
## What does Clorify do?
Clorify is an ML based application that provides people suffering from color blindness the capability to drive flawlessly on roads using machine learning based object detection and tint shifting using image processing.

## Technologies used
Machine Learning <br> 
Firebase <br> 
Tensor Flow <br>
AR Core <br>
Android SDK <br>
Nodejs <br>
Maven <br>

## Necessity
1. Helping color blind people to drive 
2. Easily recognising the colors of similar shades
3. Test the severity level of color vision deficiency

## Working
The system works in two modules:
##### DETECTION MODULE
There are three main kinds of color blindness:<br> 1. Red-green color blindness (the most common)<br> 2. Blue-yellow color blindness <br>3. A complete absence of color vision â€” total color blindness (rare). <br>The user undergoes detection process in this module which uses image based detection according to user based inputs like identifying colors via pre-defined images. This will categorise the user's color blindness for further detection.
###### Tint Shift
According to the type of blindness, the colors of the objects undergo tint shift so as to provide a better visualisation to the user.
##### CAMERA MODULE
The camera module works on the basis of output given by the previous module and the processed tint shift as per the status of color blindness of the user. This module interacts with the real time environment of the user. The major objective of this module is to provide a more primitive viewing experience through detection of objects on road like traffic lights,traffic signals and vehicles' headlights.
##### AR MODULE
It is a proposed idea which provides an AR based assistant which acts as a guide to the user

## Applications
1. Detect traffic lights and signals while driving
2. Visualising colours in daily life
3. Identifying color pigments in the field of chemistry
